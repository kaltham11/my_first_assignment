	Beneath the harsh midday sun of the Omani village, nestled between rust-colored cliffs and the endless stretch of golden sand, 
a young villager stumbled upon something strange buried behind his grandfather’s crumbling date farm. Hidden beneath layers of dust and 
dry palm leaves, it was an old leather scroll—worn, cracked, and humming faintly when held. The map inside was unlike anything he had seen before. 
It pulsed with symbols that shifted under the light, pointing toward the shadowed edge of the Al Jabal al Akhdar range, where locals whispered of 
woods that didn’t belong in this desert—woods that moved, watched, and remembered.

		That night, Elara spread the map on the woven mat in her small room, the scent of smoke from the cooking fire still hanging in the air. 
Her fingers traced the shifting lines, which seemed to pulse beneath her touch. The symbol of the ancient tree was now glowing faintly, as though it had 
been waiting for her. She had heard the stories, of course—whispers about the “woods that breathe” just beyond the high ridges, where animals avoided 
the trails and elders warned never to go after dusk. But something in the map called to her, like it knew her name without ever saying it.

			
			By morning, Elara had packed a small satchel: dried dates, a bottle of water, her grandfather’s old knife, and the map—now rolled 
and tied with a red thread. She left a short note for her mother, just enough not to cause alarm. As the sun rose behind the mountains, casting long shadows 
across the stony paths, Elara slipped quietly through the village’s edge. Her feet carried her toward the forgotten trails carved between sharp rocks and wild 
fig trees, where no one had walked in years. Whatever lay in the Whispering Woods, she knew the answers were there—and she was ready to listen.


				As Elara stepped beyond the last ridge and into the edge of the Whispering Woods, the air shifted—cooler, heavier, 
and filled with the scent of damp earth and wild herbs. The trees here were unlike any in the rest of Oman: tall, knotted, and covered in moss that 
shouldn’t have survived the desert heat. A stillness clung to the place, broken only by the soft padding of Rami beside her and the occasional rustle 
of unseen movement. Her heart pounded, not from fear, but from the weight of something ancient pressing all around her—like the forest had been waiting, 
holding its breath, just for her.


The Whispering Woods.

	Beneath the harsh midday sun of the Omani village, nestled between rust-colored cliffs and the endless stretch of golden sand, 
a young villager stumbled upon something strange buried behind his grandfather’s crumbling date farm. Hidden beneath layers of dust and 
dry palm leaves, it was an old leather scroll—worn, cracked, and humming faintly when held. The map inside was unlike anything he had seen before. 
It pulsed with symbols that shifted under the light, pointing toward the shadowed edge of the Al Jabal al Akhdar range, where locals whispered of 
woods that didn’t belong in this desert—woods that moved, watched, and remembered.

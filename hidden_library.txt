	Hidden deep beneath the roots of an ancient fig tree in the Whispering Woods lies a forgotten library, sealed by time itself. 
It can only be accessed by solving a riddle whispered by the wind at dusk. Inside, glowing manuscripts float midair, holding secrets 
of time, memory, and vanished worlds.

	Elara is a seventeen-year-old girl from a quiet mountain village near Al Jabal al Akhdar in Oman. She has deep brown eyes that rarely miss detail, 
and her skin carries the sun’s bronze from working on her family’s date farm. Known for her quiet bravery and unshakable curiosity, Elara often wanders 
beyond the village paths, drawn to places others avoid.

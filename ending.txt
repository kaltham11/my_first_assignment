	After days of navigating the shifting paths and unraveling the map’s secret symbols, Elara reached a hidden spring deep within the Whispering Woods. 
Guarded by ancient carvings and blooming with rare herbs, the place pulsed with quiet magic. She filled a small flask with its clear waters and returned to 
her village, guided by Rami and the now-silent map. In the months that followed, crops grew stronger, illnesses faded, and the once-wary villagers began to 
believe in the stories again. Elara never spoke much of what she saw, but every time the wind rustled the trees, she smiled—knowing the woods still whispered, 
and she had listened.

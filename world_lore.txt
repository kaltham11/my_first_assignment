The Language of Ancient Runes:
The Ancient Runes are a shifting script, said to be alive—each symbol changing subtly depending on who reads it. 
Only those attuned to time’s flow can truly decipher them. Often carved into stone or burned onto parchment, 
the runes unlock forgotten doors, sealed memories, and glimpses of possible futures.

The Griffin of the Sky Peaks:
High above the desert cliffs of northern Oman, the Sky Peaks are guarded by a lone Griffin—feathers like burnished copper, 
eyes like stormlight. It appears only when balance is threatened, testing the worth of those who seek passage. Stories say 
it once bowed only to the one who held the Cipher.

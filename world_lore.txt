The Language of Ancient Runes:
The Ancient Runes are a shifting script, said to be alive—each symbol changing subtly depending on who reads it. 
Only those attuned to time’s flow can truly decipher them. Often carved into stone or burned onto parchment, 
the runes unlock forgotten doors, sealed memories, and glimpses of possible futures.
